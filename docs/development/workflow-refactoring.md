# GitHub Actions Workflow Refactoring

This document summarizes the refactoring performed on the GitHub Actions workflows in this repository to improve maintainability, security, and standardization.

## Reusable Workflows

Three reusable workflows have been created to standardize common operations across all CI/CD processes:

### 1. Terraform Validation (`.github/workflows/reusable-terraform-validation.yml`)

A reusable workflow for validating Terraform code with consistent settings:

- Configurable Terraform version
- Format checking
- Initialization with or without backend
- Validation
- TFLint integration
- Summary reporting

### 2. Security Scanning (`.github/workflows/reusable-security-scan.yml`)

A reusable workflow for security scanning using Trivy:

- Configurable scan target (filesystem, repository, images)
- Output format selection (SARIF, JSON, table)
- Configurable severity filtering
- Optional upload to GitHub Security tab
- Artifact storage of scan results

### 3. Terraform Documentation (`.github/workflows/reusable-terraform-docs.yml`)

A reusable workflow for generating Terraform documentation:

- Configurable working directory
- Output file selection
- Optional Git commit and push
- Summary reporting

## Refactored Workflows

The following workflows have been refactored to use the reusable components:

### CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

- Split Terraform validation into multiple jobs using the reusable workflow
- Added a dedicated terraform-additional-checks job for OPA policy validation
- Used the reusable security scanning workflow
- Used the reusable Terraform docs workflow
- Added a workflow summary

### Dependabot Auto-Validation (`.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-validation.yml`)

- Split Terraform validation into multiple version-specific jobs using the reusable workflow
- Used the reusable security scanning workflow
- Improved job dependencies and status checking

### Build Workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`)

- Added Terraform validation using the reusable workflow
- Added security scanning using the reusable workflow
- Maintained SonarCloud integration
- Added a workflow summary

### Docs Workflow (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`)

- Used the reusable Terraform docs workflow for PR-based documentation updates
- Maintained specialized GitHub Pages deployment logic

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Standardized validation, security scanning, and documentation generation
2. **Maintainability**: Central configuration for common operations
3. **DRY principle**: Avoid duplicate code across workflows
4. **Security**: Consistent permissions and security best practices
5. **Visibility**: Added workflow summaries for better reporting

## Future Work

- Further consolidate similar jobs in release workflows
- Improve test coverage of workflow runs
- Consider additional reusable components for Go testing
